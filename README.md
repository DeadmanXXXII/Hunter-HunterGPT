       /src
     /config
     /database
     /docs
   ```

#### **Step 2: Backend Development**

##### **Task 1: Develop Core API Endpoints**

1. **Multi-GPT Integration:**
   - Create endpoints to query different GPT modules.
   - Use asynchronous requests to fetch responses from GPT-4, GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, Solomon, Cyber, Code, and Hacker GPTs simultaneously.
   - Aggregate and return these responses to the frontend.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   import openai

   app = Flask(__name__)

   openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

   gpt_modules = {
       'gpt4': 'gpt-4',
       'gpt35': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
       'chatgpt': 'chatgpt',
       'solomon': 'davinci-solomon',
       'cyber': 'davinci-cyber',
       'code': 'davinci-codex',
       'hacker': 'davinci-hacker'
   }

   @app.route('/multi-query', methods=['POST'])
   def multi_query():
       data = request.json
       query = data.get('query')
       responses = {}

       for module_name, engine in gpt_modules.items():
           response = openai.Completion.create(
               engine=engine,
               prompt=query,
               max_tokens=150
           )
           responses[module_name] = response.choices[0].text.strip()

       return jsonify(responses)
   ```

2. **GitHub Crawler:**
   - Implement a GitHub crawler that searches for relevant repositories and extracts data from README.md files.
   - Utilize the GitHub API for efficient searching and data retrieval.
   
   **Example:**
   ```python
   from github import Github

   g = Github('YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN')

   def search_github_repositories(query):
       repos = g.search_repositories(query=query)
       return repos

   def get_readme(repo):
       try:
           readme = repo.get_readme()
           return readme.decoded_content.decode()
       except:
           return "README.md not found."

   @app.route('/github-search', methods=['POST'])
   def github_search():
       data = request.json
       query = data.get('query')
       repos = search_github_repositories(query)
       repo_info = []

       for repo in repos[:3]:
           readme_content = get_readme(repo)
           repo_info.append({
               'repo_name': repo.full_name,
               'description': repo.description,
               'readme': readme_content[:500]  # Return first 500 characters
           })

       return jsonify({'repositories': repo_info})
   ```

3. **Educational Modules & Bug Bounty Programs:**
   - Set up a MongoDB database to store lists of free educational resources and bug bounty programs.
   - Develop endpoints to retrieve and filter these lists.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   from pymongo import MongoClient

   client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
   db = client.huntergpt

   @app.route('/education-modules', methods=['GET'])
   def get_education_modules():
       modules = list(db.education_modules.find())
       return jsonify(modules)

   @app.route('/bug-bounty-programs', methods=['GET'])
   def get_bug_bounty_programs():
       programs = list(db.bug_bounty_programs.find())
       return jsonify(programs)
   ```

        event.preventDefault();
        const query = document.getElementById('query').value;
        fetch('/multi-query', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ query: query }),
        })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            const responseDiv = document.getElementById('responses');
            responseDiv.innerHTML = '';
            for (const [module, answer] of Object.entries(data)) {
                const moduleDiv = document.createElement('div');
                moduleDiv.innerHTML = `<h3>${module}</h3><p>${answer}</p>`;
                responseDiv.appendChild(moduleDiv);
            }
        })
        .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
